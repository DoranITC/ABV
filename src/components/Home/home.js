              In response to the Covid 19 pandemic, we have designed a
              mechanism to automate a Bag Valve Mask (BVM) ventilator). The design comes in 3 levels.
              The first, available below is the minimum working design. We approached the first
              level with the idea that the ventilator can be automated with minimal machines &amp;
              tooling. We call this level <strong>Garage</strong>.

        In response to the Covid 19 pandemic, we intend to develop a mechanism
        to automate a BVM (Bag Valve Mask; a low-cost), widely-available,
        manually-operated ventilator). BVMs are available in 3 sizes, are
        certified for medical use and can be supplemented with oxygen where
        available. An ABVM requires more than squeezing a bag. It must also have
        adjustable tidal volume (size of breath) and BPM (Breaths per Minute).
        <br />
        <br />
        <br /> The basic design, Garage, can be made with hand tools using
        locally available materials and a few common electrical components.{" "}
        <br />
        <br /> The intermediate version, Precision, is made with machine tools
        and will incorporate more expensive elements like bearings and
        electronic control. <br />
        <br /> The final, long-term objective is to develop a high-volume,
        low-cost, CE certified version, Production, built on the learnings from
        Garage &amp; Precision. Production will use high-volume manufacturing
        methods, higher quality parts with more focus on safety and approvals.
        It will include additional functionality/features.
        <br />
        <div className="text_highlight">
          <br /> Our designs will be open-source, free for all, but not for
          profit.
          <br />
        </div>
        <br /> Success will depend on a community of users to help build and
        test prototypes and feedback design improvements. We donâ€™t want many competing designs, 
        but rather a consensus of opinion on the problem, and the best solution.
