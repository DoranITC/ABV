              available in 3 sizes, are certified for medical use and can be
              supplemented with oxygen where available.

        In response to the Covid 19 pandemic, we intend to develop a mechanism
        to automate a BVM (Bag Valve Mask; a low-cost), widely-available,
        manually-operated ventilator). BVMs are available in 3 sizes, are
        certified for medical use and can be supplemented with oxygen where
        available.
        <br />
        <br /> An ABVM requires more than squeezing a bag. It must also have
        adjustable tidal volume (size of breath) and BPM (Breaths per Minute).
        <br /> The basic design (Garage) can be made with hand tools using
        locally available materials and a few common electrical components.{" "}
        <br />
        <br /> The intermediate version (Precision) is made with machine tools
        and will incorporate more expensive elements like bearings and
        electronic control. <br />
        <br /> The final, long-term objective is to develop a high-volume,
        low-cost, CE certified version (Production) built on the learnings from
        Garage &amp; Precision. Production will use high-volume manufacturing
        methods, higher quality parts with more focus on safety and approvals.
        It will include additional functionality/features.
        <br />
        <br /> Our designs will be open-source, free for all, but not for
        profit.
        <br /> Success will depend on a community of users to help build and
        test prototypes and feedback design improvements.
        <br /> We donâ€™t want many competing designs, but rather a consensus of
        opinion on the problem, and the best solution.
        <br />
